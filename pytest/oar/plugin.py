    Here is the primary fixture to interact with OAR in PyTest. If this fixture is in the fixture list, the result of
    the test will be uploaded to OAR after the test is complete. The OAR client is designed to not fail if something
    goes wrong with the test, so an upload failure would not cause false positives.

    More info on properties:

    1. Tests default to NotAnalyzed and Unresolved
    2. If a test fails in the setup phase, the test's analysis will be marked as a FalsePositive by default
    3. If a test fails in the call phase, the test will remain NotAnalyzed
    4. If a test fails in the teardown phase, the test's analysis will be marked as a FalsePositive by default
    5. If a test passes, it is by default a TrueNegative
    6. If outcome or analysis were set during the test runtime, they will not be set by the above logic
    7. If a test is set as a specific type, the "type" will automatically be added if not already defined
